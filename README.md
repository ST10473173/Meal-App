Project Overview

The “ Meal Suggestion App” is a Kotlin-based Android application designed to simplify meal decisions by suggesting dishes based on the time of day (Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner). Users select a mealtime via an intuitive UI, and the app instantly generates a fun, emoji-accompanied suggestion using conditional logic (`if`/`when` statements). Developed in Android Studio, the app prioritizes accessibility with clear visuals and screen-reader compatibility. Hosted on “GitHub” , the project includes version control and “GitHub Actions” for automated testing and builds, ensuring reliability. This lightweight, user-friendly tool solves indecision while demonstrating Kotlin fundamentals, CI/CD workflows, and mobile development best practices all in a single, functional package.


Purpose and Features

Purpose

 - The purpose for this app is to help users ( like my friend Hera) quickly decide what to eat based on time of the day (breakfast, lunch, or dinner). It simplifies meal choices in a fun, easy to use way.


Key Features 

-Time Based Meal Suggestion
-Simple, Fast and Automatic UI
-Fun and Engaging Elements
- Reset or Clear Button 

“These features are here to help users (like my friend Hera) decide on what to eat from the time of day she enters while easy and fun to use.”

Design Considerations

1.User Interface Design

-Simplicity and Clarity: Avoid clutter, focus on core functionality (time  selection and meal suggestions).

2.User Experience Design

-Instant Feedback: Show the meal suggestion immediately after entering the time of day and pressing the “Choose Meal” button.

3.Technical Design

-Error Handling: If time of day is not entered the app should show a prompt to the user saying “Enter Time Of Day eg.(Morning).

4.Branding and Theme

-App name: Short and catch name

When the user does not enter “time of day” the app will prompt the user to input “time of day”:

When the user spells the word wrong it will promt them and say “Invalid time of day”:

Challenges and Learnings 

1.UI and UX Design

-Challenge: Making the interface intuitive yet engaging

-Solution: Previous apps and notes done in class helped me face this challenge

2.Kotlin Logic Errors

-Challenges: The if statement was not triggering correctly so i switched to the when statement 

-Solution: watch a youtube videos explaining the when statement,

3.Adding unnecessary buttons and textviews

-Challenges: Overcomplicating features 

-Solution: Sticking to what the project is asking and not what I'm asking for.

“I learnt that every bug you solve makes the app better than before, and I also need to be patient and ask for help when needed.”

Future Enhancements

Future Upgrades - Transform the meal suggestion app into a personalized, interactive tool by adding user profiles (dietary preferences/favorites), a "Surprise Me!" randomiser, and weather-based suggestions. Enhance visuals with food photos and animations, or integrate voice commands for hands-free use. Add social sharing, gamification (streaks/badges), and multilingual support. For scalability, use Firebase for cloud data and an admin panel. Optional monetization includes ad-free premium features or restaurant partnerships. Prioritize accessibility with dark mode and screen-reader improvements. This roadmap balances fun, functionality, and growth.
